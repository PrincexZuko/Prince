                    <p>During the pandemic, when the world was grappling with the uncertainties and anxieties that came with it, Netflix served as a much-needed source of comfort and entertainment for me. The streaming giant's extensive library of shows and movies provided a much-needed escape from the monotony of lockdowns and quarantines. However, one show that stood out for me was <span class="highlight">Squid Game</span>, which quickly became a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>From the moment I started watching Squid Game, I was hooked. The show's unique premise, gripping storyline, and stunning visuals had me on the edge of my seat throughout. Set in South Korea, the show follows a group of financially struggling individuals who participate in a deadly game to win a cash prize. The stakes are high, and the games are lethal, with each round becoming increasingly more dangerous and intense.</p>

        <p>Skateboarding is more than just a hobby for me; it's a lifestyle. When I step onto my board and feel the wheels rolling beneath me, I'm transported to a world of endless possibilities. The rush of the wind in my face and the sound of the wheels on the pavement is like music to my ears, and I feel free and alive.</p>
        <p>Skateboarding is not just about doing tricks and showing off; it's about challenging yourself, pushing your limits, and exploring the world around you in a whole new way. When I'm on my board, I feel like I can conquer anything, and I'm constantly amazed by what my body is capable of.</p>
        <p>Whether I'm cruising down the street, carving up a bowl, or grinding a rail, skateboarding always brings a smile to my face and a sense of pure joy to my heart. It's a way for me to escape the stresses of everyday life and just be in the moment, fully present and fully alive.</p>
        <p>In short, skateboarding is not just a hobby, it's a passion. It makes me feel alive, inspired, and free, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

        <h2>Video Games<img src="images/val.gif" alt="Valorant gif" width="95"></h2>

      
            <p>As a hobby, video games have always been a source of joy and entertainment for me. I love the feeling of getting lost in a virtual world, exploring new landscapes, and interacting with unique characters. Two games that I particularly enjoy playing are Valorant and FIFA.</p>
            <p>Valorant, a first-person shooter game, is a fast-paced and strategic game that challenges me both mentally and physically. The game requires quick reflexes and precise aim, but it also demands critical thinking and tactical planning. Every match is different, and I love the thrill of competing against other players and working with my team to achieve our goals.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, FIFA, a sports simulation game, allows me to fulfill my passion for soccer. Whether I'm playing as my favorite team or creating my own player, FIFA gives me the opportunity to experience the thrill of the game in a whole new way. The game is not only fun, but it also helps me to learn about the intricacies of soccer and the strategies used by professional players.</p>
            <p>Overall, video games, and specifically Valorant and FIFA, are an important part of my leisure time. They not only provide entertainment, but they also challenge me, help me learn new skills, and give me a sense of accomplishment.</p>
